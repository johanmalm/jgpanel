Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
jgpanel is inspired by tint2 and written in qt5 from scratch

At this stage, it's completely experimental.

jgpanel is written with the following aims:
  - Be a stand-alone panel
  - Keep feature-set small and simple
  - Work with linux and openbox
  - Contain similar settings to tint2 (e.g. padding, transparency)

Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~
	qmake
	make


Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

main.cpp   - Parses command line and sets global variables
panel.cpp  - QGraphicsView which inits scene+view and calls QGraphicsItems
server.cpp - X11 functions. E.g. get_client_list()
filter.cpp - Native event filter that emits signal on window event.

QGraphicsItems:
splash.cpp - panel background
task.cpp   - individual dock items (i.e. each running app)
launch.cpp -
clock.cpp  -
